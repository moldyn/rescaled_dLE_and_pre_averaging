During propagation, the  produced trajectory can be reflected at an upper and 
a lower border where the individual coordinates can have different sets of borders. 

For practical information please compile the program using CMake by running 

cmake -H. -Bbuild
cmake --build build -- -j3

in the shell. The Eigen package is needed for successful compilation.

The executable program will be stored in the folder build. By running

build/dLE_reflect -h

the program displays the available input options in detail together with some 
additional information. 

Intepretation of results: Please consult the references above for
information on the interpretation of the differnt columns of the output file.
