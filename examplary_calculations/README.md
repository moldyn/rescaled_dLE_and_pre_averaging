This file contains everything needed to do first runs of
the data-driven Langevin equation. As preparing steps please
download the folders

**Markov_LE_const_fields**

**Generalized_LE_const_fields**

**dLE_normal**

and compile the scripts there like described in the READMEs there.
Subsequently, save all files of this folder in **Markov_LE_const_fields**
and execute the shell-script. This will lead to the production of two
input trajectories for the dLE and two dLE trajectories as described in
the shell script itself. Please note that the individual runs are not
meant to produce converged long-time observables of the considered 
double well system. They should only give an idea of the application
of the dLE approach.

Other dLE-algorithms are applied follwing the logic presented in the
shell script.
